Node Process Self Destruct
==========================

Node modules that can be called to self destruct it's process.

##Usage
Copy this module to your Node local modules dependencies as a function constructor, see example

```node
SelfDestruct = require('./local_modules/node-process-self-destruct');
```

There are 2 methods to call scheduled self destruct:

1. Give exact date, see example
    ```node
    new SelfDestruct({
        datetime: 'yyyy,MM,dd,hh,mm,ss'
    });
    ```
where
    ```
    yyyy = years, like 2014
    MM = month, like 10
    dd = date, like 03
    hh = hours, like 10
    mm = minutes, like 30
    ss = seconds, like 10
    ```
2. Give next minutes schedule, see example
    ```
    new SelfDestruct({
        nextMinutes: 30
    });
    ```
where `nextMinutes` is an Integer that represent the next minutes that process will be ended
3. Give date object, see example
    ```
    new SelfDestruct({
        dateObject: new Date(2015, 10, 03, 05, 00, 00)
    });
    ```
where `nextMinutes` is an Integer that represent the next minutes that process will be ended
